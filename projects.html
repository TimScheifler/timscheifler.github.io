		<h2>Projects</h2>
		<p>During my time at university, I`ve been working at some smaller projects and did a practical semester to gain some extra experience. 
		<br>Me and two friends created a website for <a href="https://www.obstbrennerei-ritter.de/"> Obstbrennerei Ritter </a>, a Fruit Distellery in our second semester.
		<br>I was working one whole semester at <a href="https://www.doubleslash.de/"> doubeSlash </a>, a Software Company at the Lake Constance in Friedrichshafen, a city in Germany. I've learned many new technologies in Java and Web Development like Docker, Ansible, GraalVm and Quarkus. It was a great experience where I learned to work in organized teams, show up at meetings and solving big problems by hours of debugging. </p>
