		<h2>About me</h2>
		<p>Hi, my name is Tim Scheifler and I`m a 23year old University Student from Germany who is currently spending a semester abroad at the
		Napier University in Edinburgh.
		</br>I've started programming in 11th grade at the "Technical High School Waldshut" where I've learned the basics of Java, C and SQL. Even though I had some problems first I got hooked and decided to start studying Computer Science at the Hochschule Furtwangen in Furtwangen where I'm currently in my 6th semester.</p>
