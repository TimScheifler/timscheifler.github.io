		During my time at university, I`ve been working at some smaller projects and did a practical semester to gain some extra experience. 
		<br>Me and two friends created a website for <a href="https://www.obstbrennerei-ritter.de/"> Obstbrennerei Ritter </a> in our second semester.
		<br>I was working one whole semester at <a href="https://www.doubleslash.de/"> doubeSlash </a>, a Software Company at the Bodensee in Friedrichshafen, a city in Germany.
